# Thumby Color Snake

## Getting started

To run locally, install pygame and run it:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user
cd Games/Snakia
python3 ./run.py
```

To run on the Thumby Color, copy everything in `Games/Snakia` to the device. You
can leave out `pygameWrapper.py` and `run.py` to save some space.
